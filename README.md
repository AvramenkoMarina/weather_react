# React Weather App

This project is an online weather application that provides users with real-time weather information, forecasts, and weather data for various locations around the world. It allows users to explore current weather conditions, hourly and daily forecasts, and switch between different measurement systems (Celsius, Fahrenheit). Users can search for specific locations, view weather details, and stay updated on the weather wherever they are.
